## Objectives
Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as Content Management Systems. In this homework assignment, your challenge is to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.
The user will be prompted to answer a series of questions about which department, role and employee. 

## Deploy Link

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:ayladillis/Employee-Tracker.git
ayladillis/Employee-Tracker.git
$ cd ayladillis/Employee-Tracker.git
```
Then open in your preferred text editor:
- [vim](https://www.vim.org/) 
- [emmacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
- [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 

## Code Highlight
Here I used 'connection.queryPromise' to promisify and pull information from the roles and employee table.
